    BROWSERS

I tested how the website loked in different browsers. Firefox was the main browser. I used dev tools to resize the screen. I also wrote text on all pages on a range of devices. This worked well and I had no issues.

Google Chrome Version 107.0.5304.87 (Official Build) (arm64)

Mozilla Firefox 106.0.3 (64-bit)

    LIGHTHOUSE

I used Lighthouse for testing: Performance, Best Practices, Accessibility, and SEO.

alt text

Performance and accessibility previously had scores of 86 and 84. Lighthouse picked out large photo sizes as an issue as well as small menu text when screen size was reduced. I compressed all images and converted them to webp files. This allowed the website to perform much better. I also changed the color of the menu font. This allowed it to be viewed more clearly.

    FORM TESTING

The form has method = post and the information is sent to: https://formspree.io/f/xvoynykn for collecting data.

    I wrote in my own information and received this as a message.

    I received a notification from my formspree account showing what information had been requested.

ISSUES DURING TESTING

The issues during testing were through lighthouse. Performance and accessibility previously had scores of 86 and 84. Lighthouse picked out large photo sizes as an issue. I compressed all images and converted them to webp files. This allowed the website to perform much better. I also changed the color of the menu font. This allowed it to be viewed more clearly.

During testing I also found that the menu was too small when being used on mobile devices. I changed the size of the menu to make it more acessable.
